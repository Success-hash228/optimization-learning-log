# Optimization Learning Log

Hi, I'm Success Oloyede — third-year Computer Science student at the University of Ibadan.

This repository is my honest record of learning nature-inspired optimization and complex systems modeling. I started exploring these topics after seeing how they solve real problems in logistics, networks, and autonomous systems (topics that fascinate me because of their blend of biology and computation).

### What I'm Currently Studying
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and its variants
- Genetic Algorithms for multi-objective problems
- Basic swarm intelligence concepts
- Python implementation and experimentation

### Why This Matters to Me
Through the 3MTT foundational program and my coursework, I've realized that consistent, self-directed practice is what turns theory into usable skills. These notes represent my small daily steps in that direction.

No fancy results yet — just real learning, mistakes included, and steady progress.

Feel free to explore. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
